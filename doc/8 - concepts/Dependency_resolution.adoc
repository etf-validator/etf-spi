= ETS dependencies

This section describes the two concepts on how Ets dependencies are resolved in ETF.

== Dependency within a Test Driver

The Test Driver is responsible to resolve the Ets dependencies.

A file based ETS loader can extend the AbstractEtsFileTypeLoader class and
can mark dependencies (ETS and other metadata types) with the dependsOn() method.
TypeLoaders are then automatically executed based on a dependency graph, in the
right order.

== Cross-Test Driver dependency

A Test Driver ETS Loader must try to load the ETS from the data storage first.
If this fails, it should keep the incomplete Ets and afterwards
register to an ExecutableTestSuiteLifeCycleListenerMediator. When the required
dependency appears, the Loader can continue to add the retained ETS.

A file based ETS loader can extend the AbstractEtsFileTypeLoader class which
already implements the listener logic.
